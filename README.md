# Wan2.2 Text-to-Video Model for Mac M-Series

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repository has the sole purpose of making Wan2.2 run efficiently on Mac M-Series chips. Memory saving is the priority.

## Original problems

Mac M-Series chips have Unified Memory, so the original method of offloading models to the CPU still costs memory.

The original repo also loads all models at startup, which takes a lot of memory. (umt5-xxl is a 13B model!!)

## Changes

- Load models only when needed. (T5, base model, and vae)
- Modify the offload_model method to delete the model from memory immediately after use.
- Add quantized T5 model to reduce memory usage.
- Use bf16 precision to reduce memory usage.

## Problems

- VAE tiling for VAE2.2 is broken now.

## TODO

- Fix VAE tiling for VAE2.2.
- Add support for A14B model.

## Installation

Follow the upstream instructions to install the dependencies and download the model.

Assuming you have Poetry installed, you can also install the dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you want to use hugingface-cli or modelscope, you can install with:

```bash
poetry install --extras dev
```

Download the model with huggingface-cli or modelscope:

```bash
hf download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --local-dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B
hf download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --local-dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B
hf download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --local-dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B
```

```bash
modelscope download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --local_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B
modelscope download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --local_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B
modelscope download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --local_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B
```

To use quantized T5 model, [download it](https://huggingface.co/HighDoping/umt5-xxl-encode-gguf/resolve/main/umt5-xxl-encode-only-Q4_K_M.gguf) from my [🤗 repo](https://huggingface.co/HighDoping/umt5-xxl-encode-gguf) or use huggingface-cli and put it in the same folder as wan model:

```bash
huggingface-cli download HighDoping/umt5-xxl-encode-gguf --local-dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B
```

[Models from city96](https://huggingface.co/city96/umt5-xxl-encoder-gguf) also works. Only needs to change the model name in ```wan\configs```

Then install llama.cpp from homebrew:

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
```

## Usage

### Text to video with Wan2.2-TI2V-5B

To generate a video, use the following command:

```bash
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size "1280*704" --frame_num 41 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_quant --device mps --prompt "Penguins fighting a polar bear in the arctic." --save_file output_video.mp4
```

```--t5_quant``` enables the quantized T5 model.

### Image to video with Wan2.2-TI2V-5B

```bash
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size "1280*704" --frame_num 25 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_quant --device mps --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
